Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- My class ContractImplements implements the commands given in Contract.java. It is a very simple interpretation, but it does the job. 
- I also added two methods to print the inventory and the previously run commands so that you could easily see what is in the inventory and what methods have been executed. 
- I think everything worked well. I think my advice would be to not overcomplicate it.
